#Initial Set of Rules

**101.** All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins.

**102.** No rule may make it possible for a player to win the game or end the game.

**103.** A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a rule.

**104.** All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

**106.** All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.

**107.** No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.

**108.** Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended it receives the number of the proposal to amend  it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.

**110.** In order for a player to be active they must be on the active players list. Any player can make a proposal for another player(s) to be declared inactive. A player will be declared inactive if the following criteria have been met: (1) A majority of active players, minus the players who are being declared inactive, must accept the proposal, (2) a 24 hour business day must have passed from the time the proposal was created, (3) none of the players who are being declared inactive have performed any action since the proposal was created. The creator of the proposal may cancel their proposal at any time.

**111.** If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote.

**112.** A player may add themselves to the active players list to become active. No individual may control more than one active player.

**113.** A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

**114.** The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.

**115.** Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

**116.** Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

**202.** One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.

In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)

**205.** An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.

**207.** Each player always has exactly one vote.

**211.** If two or more rules conflict with one another then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

**212.** If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.

The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

**213.** If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then a constitutional convention should be held.

**304.** PARSING VOTES: A vote must be a Pull Request (PR) comment containing only a "yay" (a vote for a proposal) or a "nay" (a vote against a proposal). Case sensitivity is irrelevant. 
It is important, for parsing, that no other non-space characters be included in the comment body. The comment must be attached to the PR itself, and not associated with any specific file.

**305.** No player may be a judge in a dispute in which they are involved.

**306.** PARSING PROPOSALS: A rule-change proposal must be submitted as a PR to the repository with a title which begins with only the numerical ordinal of the proposed rule. No other characters may preceed this number, and the number may not be written in word form.

**307.** PARSING VOTES: Only the most recent vote will be counted. All other votes by a given player will be ignored.

**308.** If any players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, any player may call for a Judgement. A Judgement is created by opening an issue. The issue must contain a summary of the dispute at hand.

**310.** Players may exchange points. After points have been exchanged between the given players the total amount of points post exchange must equal the total amount of points pre exchange.

**311.** A proposal must be voted on by more than 50% of active players (a quorum) in order to be resolved (accepted or rejected) unless otherwise noted in the rules. Any time after a proposal has reached a quorum it may be resolved by its creator. A rule-change is a proposal.

**316.** No law may target a specific player.

**317.** A player cannot have negative points.

**318.** A player may not vote on a rule-change proposal if he/she has not yet voted on a lower ordinal, rule-change proposal which is in an "Open for Voting" state.

**319.** VOTING INCENTIVE: All players who vote on rule-change proposal shall roll 2d6+1 and receive a number of points equal to the value of the roll if and only if the proposal reaches a quorum.

**321.** Declarations of War made before this law was inacted are null and void. All open declarations should be closed.

**325.** In order for a rule-change proposal to be adopted once a quorum is reached, more than 50% of the votes must be positive (yay). In the event of a tie, the proposal may either be removed by the creator, or it may remain open until the tie is broken.

**327.** **VILLAGES:** This rule governs initial village definitions.

  - **SECTION 1** Each Active Player oversees a Village. All Villages must abide by any rules defined herein. Villages may enact their own ruleset under the proviso no Village Rule conflicts with rules defined herein. 
  
  - **SECTION 2** If a player's Village Population drops to zero (0), the player looses all points, property, and any other resources. 
  
  - **SECTION 3** Initial Village Populations are defined by rolling 12d12+12.
  
  - **SECTION 4** Village names and descriptions are at the descression of the Overseeer of the village, though resources, population growth, and prosperity must be determined by the rules defined herein. 

**328.** **FARM PURCHASES:** Active Players with a village may purchase farms for 10 points each.

**329.** **FARM PRODUCTION:** Farms produce enough food to feed 1d12+12 people per week.

**330.** **FEED THE PEOPLE:** 
  - **SECTION 1** Active Players with a Village must have enough Farms to feed the Village's Population or become at risk for Starvation.

  - **SECTION 2** Hunger will occur once per week. The Hunger will be equal to the Village's Population at the time of calculation.

  - **SECTION 3** Farm production will be calculated at the time of Hunger and used to reduce the Village's Hunger.
   
  - **SECTION 4** If there is a positive Hunger value after Farm production, an issue will be created and assigned to the Active Player.
   
  - **SECTION 5** During the next week, the Active Player may purchase additional Farms which will immediatly calculate production, and reduce the Hunger value.

  - **SECTION 6** A negative Hunger value indicates a surplus and will be considered stored, and used to reduce the next Hunger calculation.

  - **SECTION 7** If a Village has a pre-existing positive Hunger value when Hunger strikes, Starvation will occur and the village's population will be reduced by the Hunger value.

**331.** **POPULATION GROWTH:** An Active Player's Village will grow once per month using the following formula:
```
N = ⌊ N * e ^ (0.011 + ( 1 / ( (H + N) ^ 2 + 1) ) ) ⌋
```
Where N is the value of the population at the time of the calculation and H is the value of hunger at the time of the calculation.

**332.** Players should add a description of their village. Players will be rewarded 100 points the first time they add a description of their village.

**333.** All villages reside on the same planet. This planet's name is Credo.

**337.** People may move from one village to another. People are defined as a subset of a given village's population. After people have moved between villages the total amount of people post exchange must equal the total amount of people pre exchange. The players involved in the moving of people must all agree to the terms of the movement prior actually moving the people. Agreement will be done in the pr to move the people. Each player involved in the exchange must vote yay in order for the pr to be merged.

**338.** Players data may not be set or updated unless explicitly stated in the rules.

**339.** If a source village has a positive Hunger value during a transfer of People, a positive Hunger value equal to the number of People involved in any transfer will follow the People to the destination village.

**340.** **SURPLUS EXCHANGE:** A player whose Village has a negative Hunger (a Surplus) may transfer any of that Surplus to any other Player's Village for any exchange which both Players agree.

**341.** **POPULATION ALLOCATION:** Village Populations may be allocated to specific endeavors. While allocated, they are still counted as part of the population and may only be allocated to a single endeavor. Villagers who are not allocated are considered allocated to the general endeavor.

**342.** **FARMING ENDEAVOR:** Each farm requires 2 villagers allocated to the farming endeavor in order to produce.

**344.** **INITIAL PLAYER POINTS:** New Players, upon their first creation, will be awarded an initial point value set by a roll (1d12 + 12).

**345.** **SAWMILL PURCHASES:** All players with a village may purchase sawmills for one hundred (100) points each. Sawmills produce Lumber.

**346.** **SAWMILL PRODUCTION:** Each Sawmill will produce 1d12+3 lumber per week as long as six (6) villagers per sawmill are allocated to the logging endevor. 

**347.** **Synthetic Materials:** Any production of Synthetic Materials (Materials artificially created through chemical reactions) within a village reduces farm output by eight (8) units.

**348.** **Happiness:** Each village has a happiness level. Each village starts off with 0 Happiness. Happiness ranges from -5 to +5. Happiness may only be changed in a village as explicitly stated in the rules.

**350** Adding features to the bot is a proposal. All voting rules that apply to rule changes also apply to adding features to the bot. This rule does not apply to bug fixes.

**351** *No More Nomads:** A player may not be active unless they have a village. All active players who do not have a village at the time of this proposal is accepted will be moved to inactive.
